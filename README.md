# About this Workspace

Clone this repository and populate with your own vignettes to add resources to AnVIL via AnVILPublish.

Note that an AnVILPublish repository must include a DESCRIPTION file, NAMESPACE file, and have at least one `.Rmd` file. See [this tutorial](https://github.com/jhudsl/AnVIL_Book_Getting_Started/blob/anvilpublish/0X-AnVILPublish.Rmd) for more information about using AnVILPublish.

This README.md appears as a section at the bottom of the Workspace Dashboard if the `use_readme = TRUE` argument is used in `AnVILPublish::as_workspace()`. This README should be freely customized after you make this skeleton your own!
